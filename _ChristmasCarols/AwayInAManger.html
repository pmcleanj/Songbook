            Away in a  Manger<br>
<br>
<br>
 <br>
Verse 1<br>
<br>
Away in a  manger, no crib for a bed<br>
The little Lord Jesus lay down his sweet head<br>
The stars in the sky look down where he lay<br>
The  little Lord Jesus asleep on  the  hay.     <br>
<br>
<br>
Verse 2<br>
<br>
The cattle are lowing, the Baby a-wakes<br>
But little Lord Jesus, no crying He makes <br>
I love Thee, Lord Jesus, look down from the sky<br>
And stay by my cradle 'til morning is   nigh<br>
<br>
<br>
Verse 3<br>
<br>
Be near me, Lord Jesus, I ask Thee to stay <br>
Close by me for-ever, and love me, I pray<br>
Bless all the dear children in Thy tender care<br>
And take us to Heaven to live with Thee there<br>
