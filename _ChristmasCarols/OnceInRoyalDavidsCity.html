Once in Royal David's City<br>
<br>
<br>
Verse 1<br>
<br>
Once in royal David s city,<br>
stood a lowly cattle shed<br>
Where a mother laid her Baby,<br>
in a manger for His bed<br>
Mary was that mother mild,<br>
Jesus Christ, her little Child.<br>
<br>
<br>
Verse 2<br>
<br>
He came down to earth from heaven,<br>
who is God and Lord of all<br>
And His shelter was a stable,<br>
and His cradle was a stall<br>
With the poor, and mean, and lowly,<br>
lived on earth our Savior holy.<br>
<br>
<br>
Verse 3<br>
<br>
And, through all His wondrous childhood,<br>
he would honor and obey<br>
Love and watch the lowly maiden,<br>
in whose gentle arms He lay<br>
Christian children all must be,<br>
mild, obedient, good as He.<br>
<br>
<br>
Verse 4<br>
<br>
For He is our childhood's pattern;<br>
day by day, like us, He grew<br>
He was little, weak, and helpless,<br>
tears and smiles, like us He knew<br>
And He cares when we are sad,<br>
and he shares when we are glad.<br>
<br>
<br>
Verse 5<br>
<br>
And our eyes at last shall see Him,<br>
through His own redeeming love<br>
For that Child so dear and gentle,<br>
is our Lord in heaven above<br>
And He leads His children on,<br>
to the place where He is gone.<br>
