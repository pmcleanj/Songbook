The First Nowell<br>
<br>
verse 1<br>
<br>
The first Noel, the angels did say <br>
was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay <br>
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep <br>
On a cold winter's night that was so  deep <br>
<br>
<br>
chorus<br>
<br>
  Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel<br>
  Born is the King of Israel <br>
  <br>
  <br>
verse 2<br>
<br>
They looked up and saw a star <br>
Shining in the east beyond them far <br>
And to the earth it gave great light <br>
And so it continued both day and night <br>
<br>
<br>
verse 3<br>
<br>
And by the light of that same star <br>
Three wise men came from coun try far<br>
To seek for-a king was their intent <br>
and to follow the star whereever it went<br>
<br>
<br>
verse 4<br>
<br>
That star drew nigh to the northwest<br>
O'er Beth lehe -m it took its rest<br>
and there it did both stop and stay<br>
right over the place where Jesus lay<br>
<br>
<br>
verse 5<br>
<br>
Then entered in those wise men three<br>
Full rev 'rently upon their knee<br>
And offered there in his presence<br>
Their gold and mhyrr and frankinsence<br>
<br>
<br>
verse 6<br>
<br>
So let us all with one accord<br>
Give prais es to our ri sen Lord<br>
Who hast made Heav'n and Earth of nought<br>
And with his blood mankind hath bought<br>
<br>
