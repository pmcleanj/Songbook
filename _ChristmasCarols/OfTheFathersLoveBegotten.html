Of the Father’s love begotten<br>
<br>
<br>
Of the Father’s love begotten, ere the worlds began to be,<br>
He is Alpha and Omega, He the source, the ending He,<br>
Of the things that are, that have been,<br>
And that future years shall see, evermore and evermore!<br>
<br>
<br>
verse 2<br>
<br>
O that birth forever blessed, when the virgin, full of grace,<br>
By the Holy Ghost conceiving, bare the Savior of our race;<br>
And the Babe, the world’s Redeemer,<br>
First revealed His sacred face, evermore and evermore!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
verse 3<br>
 <br>
This is He Whom heav’n taught singers, chanted of with one accord;<br>
Whom the voices of the prophets promised in their faithful word;<br>
Now He shines, the long expected,<br>
Let creation praise its Lord, evermore and evermore!<br>
<br>
<br>
verse 4<br>
<br>
O ye heights of heaven adore Him; angel hosts, His praises sing;<br>
Powers, dominions, bow before Him, and extol our God and King!<br>
Let no tongue on earth be silent,<br>
Every voice in concert sing, evermore and evermore!<br>
<br>
<br>
verse 5<br>
<br>
Christ, to Thee<br>
with God the Father, and, O Holy Ghost, to Thee,<br>
Hymn and chant with high thanksgiving, and unwearied praises be:<br>
Honor, glory, and dominion,and eternal victory, evermore and evermore!<br>
<br>
<br>
verse 6<br>
<br>
At His Word the worlds were framed; He commanded; it was done:<br>
Heaven and earth and depths of ocean in their threefold order one;<br>
All that grows beneath the shining<br>
Of the moon and burning sun, evermore and evermore!<br>
<br>
<br>
verse 7<br>
<br>
He is found in human fashion, death and sorrow here to know,<br>
That the race of Adam’s children doomed by law to endless woe,<br>
May not henceforth die and perish<br>
In the dreadful gulf below, evermore and evermore!<br>
<br>
<br>
verse 8<br>
<br>
Righteous judge of souls departed, righteous King of them that live,<br>
On the Father’s throne exalted none in might with Thee may strive;<br>
Who at last invengeance coming<br>
Sinners from Thy face shalt drive, evermore and evermore!<br>
<br>
<br>
verse 9<br>
<br>
Thee let old men, thee let young men, thee let boys in chorus sing;<br>
Matrons, virgins, little maidens, with glad voices answering:<br>
Let their guileless songs re-echo,<br>
And the heart its music bring, evermore and evermore!<br>
