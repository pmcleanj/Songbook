Joy to the world the Lord is come<br>
Let earth receive her King<br>

And heav'n and nature sing<br>
And heav'n and nature sing<br>
And heav'n and heaven and nature sing<br>
<br>
Verse 2<br>

Joy to the world the Savior reigns<br>
Let men their songs employ<br>
while fields and floods, rocks, hills and plains<br>
Repeat their sounding joy<br>
Repeat their sounding joy<br>
Repeat repeat their sounding joy<br>
<br>
Verse 3<br>
<br>
No more let sins and sorrows grow,<br>
Nor thorns infest the ground;<br>
He comes to make His blessing flow<br>
Far as the curse is found,<br>
Far as the curse is found,<br>
Far as, far as the curse is found<br>
<br>
Verse 4<br>

He rules the world with truth and grace<br>
And makes the nations prove<br>
The glories of His righteousness<br>
And wonders of His love,<br>
And wonders of His love,<br>
And wonders, wonders of His love<br>
