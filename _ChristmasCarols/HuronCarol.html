The Huron Carol<br>
<br>

verse 1<br>
<br>
  'Twas in the moon of wintertime when all the birds had fled, <br>
  That mighty Gitchi Manitou sent angel choirs instead; <br>
  Before their light the stars grew dim, <br>
     and wondâ€™ring hunters heard the hymn <br>
  Jesus your King is born, Jesus is born, <br>
   In excelsis gloria. <br>
<br>
<br>
verse 2<br>
<br>
Within a lodge of broken bark the tender Babe was found, <br>
A ragged robe of rabbit skin enwrapp'd His beauty round; <br>
But as the hun -ter braves drew nigh, the angel song rang loud and high... <br>
  Jesus your King is born, Jesus is born, <br>
   In excelsis gloria. <br>
<br>
<br>
verse 3<br>
<br>
The earliest moon of wintertime is not so round and fair,<br>
As was the ring of glory on the helpless infant there;<br>
The chiefs from far before him knelt with gifts of fox and beaver pelt.<br>
  Jesus your King is born, Jesus is born, <br>
   In excelsis gloria. <br>
<br>
verse 4<br>
O children of the forest free, O sons of Manitou, <br>
The Holy Child of earth and heaven is born today for you. <br>
Come kneel before the radiant Boy who brings you beauty, peace and joy.<br>
  Jesus your King is born, Jesus is born, <br>
   In excelsis gloria. <br>
