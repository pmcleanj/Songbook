Jingle Bells<br>
<br>
Verse 1<br>
<br>
Dashing through the snow, in a one-horse open sleigh,<br>
O'er the fields we go, laughing all the way,<br>
Bells on bobtails ring, making spirits bright,<br>
What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight, oh<br>
<br>
<br>
CHORUS:<br>
<br>
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way,<br>
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh, hey,<br>
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way,<br>
COh what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh. <br>
<br>
<br>
verse 2<br>
<br>
A day or two ago, I thought I'd take a ride<br>
And soon Miss Fanny Bright, was seated by my side<br>
The horse was lean and lank, misfortune seemed his lot<br>
He got into a drifted bank and we, we got up-sot, oh<br>
<br>
<br>
verse 3<br>
<br>
A day or two ago, the story I must tell<br>
I went out on the snow and on my back I fell<br>
A gent was riding by, In a one-horse open sleigh,<br>
He laughed as there I sprawling laid, but quickly drove away, oh<br>
<br>
<br>
verse 4: <br>
<br>
Now the ground is white, go it while you're young,<br>
Take the girls tonight and sing this sleighing song;<br>
Just get a bob-tailed bay two-forty as his speed<br>
Hitch him to an open sleigh and crack! you'll take the lead, Oh<br>
<br>
<br>
