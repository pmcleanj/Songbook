God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen<br>
<br>
God rest ye merry gentlemen, let nothing you dismay.<br>
Remember Christ our Sav - iour was born on Christmas Day<br>
to save us all from Satan's power, when we were gone astray<br>
<br>
Chorus: <br>
<br>
O tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy<br>
O tidings of comfort and joy<br>
<br>
<br>
From God our heavenly Fa - ther, a blessed angel came<br>
and unto certain shep - herds brought tidings of the same<br>
How that in Bethlehem was born the Son of God by name<br>
<br>
