Silent Night<br>
<br>
<br>
verse 1<br>
<br>
Silent night, holy night<br>
All is calm, all is bright<br>
Round yon virgin mother and child,<br>
Holy infant so tender and mild,<br>
Sleep in heavenly peace,<br>
Sleep in heavenly peace,<br>
<br>
verse 2<br>
<br>
<br>
Silent night, holy night,<br>
Shepherds quake at the sight.<br>
Glories stream from heaven afar,<br>
Heavenly hosts sing alleluia;<br>
Christ the Saviour, is born!<br>
Christ the Saviour, is born!<br>
<br>
verse 3<br>
<br>
Silent night, holy night,<br>
Son of God, love's pure light!<br>
Radiant beams from Thy holy face,<br>
With the dawn of redeeming grace,<br>
Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth,<br>
Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth.<br>
