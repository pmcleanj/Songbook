verse 1<br>

Angels from the realms of glory,<br>
Wing your flight o'er all the earth;<br>
Ye who sang creation's story<br>
Now proclaim the Messiah's birth.<br>

Come and worship, come and worship<br>
Worship Christ, the newborn King.<br>

Shepherds, in the field abiding,<br>
Watching over your flocks by night,<br>
God with us is now residing;1<br>
Yonder shines the infant light<br>

Sages, leave your contemplations,<br>
Brighter visions beam afar;<br>
Seek the great Desire of nations;<br>
Ye have seen His natal star.<br>

Saints, before the altar bending,<br>
Watching long in hope and fear;<br>
Suddenly the Lord, descending,<br>
In His temple shall appear.<br>

Sinners, wrung with true repentance,<br>
Doomed for guilt to endless pains,<br>
Justice now revokes the sentence,<br>
Mercy calls you, break your chains<br>

Though an infant now we view Him,<br>
He shall fill His Father's throne,<br>
Gather all nations to Him;<br>
Every knee shall then bow down<br>

Lord of Heaven, we adore Thee,<br>
God the Father, God the Son,<br>

On the same eternal throne<br>

All creation, join in praising<br>
God, the Father, Spirit, Son,<br>
Evermore your voices raising<br>
To the eternal Three in One<br>
