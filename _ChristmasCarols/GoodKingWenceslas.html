Good King Wenceslas<br>
<br>
<br>
Verse 1<br>
<br>
Good King Wenceslas looked out<br>
On the feast of Stephen,<br>
When the snow lay round about,<br>
Deep and crisp and even.<br>
Brightly shone the moon that night,<br>
Though the frost was cruel,<br>
When a poor man came in sight,<br>
Gathering winter fuel.<br>
<br>
Verse 2<br>
<br>
<font color=red>
"Hither, page, and stand by me.<br>
If thou know it telling:<br>
Yonder peasant, who is he?<br>
Where and what his dwelling?"<br></font>
<font color=blue>
"Sire, he lives a good league hence,<br>
Underneath the mountain,<br>
Right against the forest fence<br>
By Saint Agnes fountain."<br></font>
<br>
Verse 3<br>
<br>
<font color=red>
"Bring me flesh, and bring me wine.<br>
Bring me pine logs hither.<br>
Thou and I will see him dine<br>
When we bear the thither."<br></font>
Page and monarch, forth they went,<br>
Forth they went together<br>
Through the rude wind's wild lament<br>
And the bitter weather
<br>
Verse 4<br>
<br>
<font color=blue>
"Sire, the night is darker now,<br>
And the wind blows stronger.<br>
Fails my heart, I know not how.<br>
I can go no longer."<br></font>
<font color=red>
"Mark my footsteps my good page,<br>
Tread thou in them boldly<br>
Thou shalt find the winter's rage<br>
Freeze thy blood less coldly."<br></font>
<br>
Verse 5<br>
<br>
In his master's step he trod<br>
Where the snow lay dented.<br>
Heat was in the very sod<br>
Which the saint had printed.<br>
Therefore, Christian men, be sure,<br>
Wealth or rank possessing,<br>
Ye who now will bless the poor<br>
Shall yourselves find blessing.<br>
