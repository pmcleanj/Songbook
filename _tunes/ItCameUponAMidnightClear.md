##### verse 1  
  
It came up-on the midnight clear  
That glorious song of old  
From angels bending near the earth  
With news of joy foretold  
Peace on the earth, good will to men  
From heaven's all gracious King  
The world in solemn stillness lay  
To hear the angels sing.  
  
##### verse 2  
  
Still through the cloven skies they come  
With peaceful wings unfurled  
And still their heavenly music floats  
O'er all the weary world  
A-bove its sad and lowly plains  
Old echoes plaintive ring  
And ever o'er its Babel sounds  
The blessed angels sing.  
  
##### verse 3  
  
Yet with the woes of sin and strife  
The world has suffered long;  
Beneaath the angel strain have rolled  
two thousand years of wrong;  
and man at war with man hears not  
the words of peace they bring.  
O hush your noise ye men of strife,  
And hear the angels sing.  
  
##### verse 4  
  
O ye, beneath life's crushing load  
Whose forms are bending low  
Who toil along the climbing way  
With painful steps and slow  
Look now for glad and golden hours  
Come swiftly on the wing  
O rest be-side the weary road  
And hear the angels sing.  
  
##### verse 5  
  
For lo, the days are hastening on,  
by prophets seen of old  
When with the every circling years  
comes round the age of gold  
when the new heaven and earth shall own  
The Prince of Peace thier King  
And the whole world send back the song  
Which now the angels sing.
