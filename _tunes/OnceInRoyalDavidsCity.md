##### Verse 1  
  
Once in royal David s city,  
stood a lowly cattle shed  
Where a mother laid her Baby,  
in a manger for His bed  
Mary was that mother mild,  
Jesus Christ, her little Child.  
  
  
##### Verse 2  
  
He came down to earth from heaven,  
who is God and Lord of all  
And His shelter was a stable,  
and His cradle was a stall  
With the poor, and mean, and lowly,  
lived on earth our Savior holy.  
  
  
##### Verse 3  
  
And, through all His wondrous childhood,  
he would honor and obey  
Love and watch the lowly maiden,  
in whose gentle arms He lay  
Christian children all must be,  
mild, obedient, good as He.  
  
  
##### Verse 4  
  
For He is our childhood's pattern;  
day by day, like us, He grew  
He was little, weak, and helpless,  
tears and smiles, like us He knew  
And He cares when we are sad,  
and he shares when we are glad.  
  
  
##### Verse 5  
  
And our eyes at last shall see Him,  
through His own redeeming love  
For that Child so dear and gentle,  
is our Lord in heaven above  
And He leads His children on,  
to the place where He is gone.
