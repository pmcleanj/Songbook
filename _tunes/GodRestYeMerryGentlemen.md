God rest ye merry gentlemen, let nothing you dismay.  
Remember Christ our Sav - iour was born on Christmas Day  
to save us all from Satan's power, when we were gone astray  
  
##### Chorus:   
  
O tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy  
O tidings of comfort and joy  
  
  
From God our heavenly Fa - ther, a blessed angel came  
and unto certain shep - herds brought tidings of the same  
How that in Bethlehem was born the Son of God by name
