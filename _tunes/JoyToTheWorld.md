Joy to the world the Lord is come  
Let earth receive her King  
Let every heart prepare Him room  
And heav'n and nature sing  
And heav'n and nature sing  
And heav'n and heaven and nature sing  
  
##### Verse 2  
  
Joy to the world the Savior reigns  
Let men their songs employ  
while fields and floods, rocks, hills and plains  
Repeat their sounding joy  
Repeat their sounding joy  
Repeat repeat their sounding joy  
  
##### Verse 3  
  
No more let sins and sorrows grow,  
Nor thorns infest the ground;  
He comes to make His blessing flow  
Far as the curse is found,  
Far as the curse is found,  
Far as, far as the curse is found  
  
V##### erse 4  
  
He rules the world with truth and grace  
And makes the nations prove  
The glories of His righteousness  
And wonders of His love,  
And wonders of His love,  
And wonders, wonders of His love
