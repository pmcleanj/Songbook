##### Intro:  
You know Dasher; and Dancer; and Prancer; and Vixen,  
         Comet;  and Cupid;  and Donner;  and Blitzen.  
But do you recall... The most famous reindeer of all?   
  
  
##### Verse 1:  
  
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer (reindeer).i|  
Had a very shiny nose (like a light bulb)   
And if you ever saw it (saw it)   
You would even say it glows (like a flash light)  
  
  
##### Verse 2:  
  
All of the other reindeer (reindeer)  
Used to laugh and call him names (like Pinocchio)   
They'd never let poor Rudolph (Rudolph)   
join in any reindeer games (like Monopoly)   
  
  
##### Bridge:  
  
Then one foggy Christmas Eve   
Santa came to say (Ho Ho Ho)   
Rudolph with your nose so bright   
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?   
  
##### Verse 3:  
  
Then how the reindeer loved him (loved him)  
as they shouted out with glee (yippee)  
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer (reindeer).i|  
ou'll go down in history (like Columbus)
