Sing choirs of angels,  
sing in exultation,  
O sing, all ye citizens of heaven above!  
Glory to God, all glory in the highest!  
  
  
##### Verse 3  
  
God of God,  
Light of Light,  
Lo, he abhoreth not the Virgin's womb;  
Son of the Father, begotten, not created;  
  
##### Verse 4  
  
See how the shepherds,  
summoned to His cradle,  
Leaving their flocks, draw nigh to gaze;  
We too will thither bend our joyful footsteps;  
  
##### Verse 5  
  
Yea, Lord, we greet Thee,  
born this happy morning,  
Jesus, to Thee be all glory given;  
Word of the Father, now in flesh appearing!
