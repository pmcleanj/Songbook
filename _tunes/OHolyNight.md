##### Verse 1  
  
O Holy night! The stars are brightly shining,  
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth!  
Long lay the world, in sin and error pining,  
'Till He appeared, and the soul felt its worth.  
A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices,  
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn!  
Fall on your knees! O hear the angel voices!  
O night divine, O night When Christ was born,  
O night, divine, O night, O night divine!  
  
##### Verse 2  
  
Led by the light of faith serenely beaming  
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand  
So led by light of a star sweetly gleaming  
Here came the wise men from Orient land  
The King of Kings lay in a lowly manger  
In all our trials born to be our friend  
He knows our need, to our weakness no stranger  
Behold your King, before him lowly bend  
Behold your King, your King! Before Him lowly bend  
  
##### Verse 3  
  
Truly He taught us to love one another.  
His law is Love, and His gospel is Peace.  
Chains shall He break, For the slave is our brother  
And in His Name all oppression shall cease.  
Sweet hymns of joy, In grateful chorus raise we,  
Let all within us praise His Holy Name!  
Christ is the Lord, O praise His Name forever;  
His pow'r and glory ever more proclaim,  
His pow'r and glory ever more proclaim.
