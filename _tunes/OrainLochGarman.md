  ##### Verse 1
Good people all, this Christmas-time,  
Consider well and bear in mind  
What our good God for us has done,  
In sending His beloved Son.  
With Mary holy we should pray  
To God with love this Christmas Day:  
In Bethlehem upon that morn  
There was a blessed Messiah born.  
  
  ##### Verse 2
Near Bethlehem did shepherds keep  
Their flocks of lambs and feeding sheep;  
To whom God's angels did appear,  
Which put the shepherds in great fear.  
"Arise and go," the angels said,  
"To Bethlehem, be not afraid;  
For there you'll find this happy morn  
A princely Babe, sweet Jesus born."  
  
  ##### Verse 3
With thankful heart and joyful mind,  
The shepherds went the Babe to find,  
And as God's angel had foretold,  
They did our Saviour Christ behold.  
Within a manger He was laid,  
And by his side the Virgin Maid,  
As long foretold, upon that morn  
there was a blessed Messiah born

  ##### Rann 1
O mulaidhean puinnseanta  
An leanabh leanabh anns an leabaidh  
Tha ia 'cuimhneachadh air gràdh an Rìgh  
Cò thug seachad liberation a-nochd air an t-nail  
Màth-mhàthair ann am Bealach Dhè  

##### Rann 2  
Clann bhochd Eubha  
Ùrnaigh a-nis cho slaodach  
Tha doras an dorchada gu bràth  
Tha mi fhathast ag adhradh Mac Rí na hÓighe  
 ##### Rann 3 
San ear-thuath ann am meadhan na h-oidhche  
Bha an deagh naidheachd math dha na cìobairean  
Tha e soilleir gu bheil beatha anns na speuran sin fìor  
Bhiodh na h-ainglean a 'seinn bho phut gu tip  
 ##### Rann 4 
Gluais gu beatha, ainglean Dhè  
Dèan cinnteach agus gheibh thu e  
Leig gu sàmhach ann an crann connlaich  
Is e Prionnsa, Mac an Rìgh an cathair.  
##### Rann 5  
  
<!-- 
Oh toxic aches  
The lean baby in the bed  
She remembers the love of the King  
Who gave liberation tonight of the nail  
A Mother Mother in God's Pass  
  
The poor children of Eve  
Pray now so slowly  
The door of the chore is forever  
I still worship Mac Rí na hÓighe  
  
In eastern East in the middle of the night  
The good news was good for the shepherds  
That life in the sky is clearly untrue  
Angels sang from tip to tip  
  
Move to life, God's angels  
Be sure and you'll get it  
'Lie silently in a straw crane  
The Prince, Son of the King is the seat.
