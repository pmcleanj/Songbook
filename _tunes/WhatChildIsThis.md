##### verse 1  
  
What Child Is This Who Laid To Rest  
On Mary's Lap Is Sleeping  
Whom Angels Greet With Anthems Sweet  
While Shepherds Watch Are Keeping  
This, This Is Christ The King  
Whom Shepherds Guard And Angels Sing  
Haste, Haste To Bring Him Laud  
The Babe The Son Of Mary  
  
##### verse 2  
  
Why lies His in such mean estate  
Where ox and ass are feeding?  
Good Christian, fear for sinners here  
The silent Word is pleading  
Nails, Sword shall pierce Him through  
The Cross be borne for me, for you  
Hail, hail the Word made flesh,  
The Babe The Son Of Mary  
  
##### verse 3  
  
So Bring Him Incense , Gold And Myrrh  
Come Peasant, King, To Own Him  
The King Of Kings Salvation Brings  
Let Loving Hearts Enthrone Him  
Raise, raise a song on high,  
The virgin sings her lullaby.  
Joy, joy for Christ is born,  
The Babe, the Son of Mary.
