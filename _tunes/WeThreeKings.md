##### Verse 1  
  
We three kings of orient are  
Bearing gifts, we traverse afar  
Field and fountain, moor and mountain  
following yonder star  
  
  
##### chorus  
  
O â€“ o,   
Star of wonder, star of night  
Star with royal beauty bright  
Westward leading, still proceeding  
guide us to thy perfect light  
  
  
##### Verse 2  
  
Born a king on Bethlehem's plain  
Gold I bring to crown hHim again  
King forever, ceasing never  
over us all to reign  
  
  
##### Verse 3  
  
Frankinsence to offer have I.  
Incense owns a deity nigh.  
Prayer and praising all men raising  
Worship him: God most high.  
  
  
##### Verse 4  
  
Mhyrr is mine, its bitter perfume  
Breathes a life of gathering gloom  
Sorrowing, sighing, bleeding, dying  
sealed in a stone-cold tomb  
  
  
##### Verse 5  
  
Glorious now behold him arise  
King and God and Sacrifice  
Alleluia, alleluia  
earth to the heavens replies.
