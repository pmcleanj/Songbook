##### Verse 1  
  
Dashing through the snow, in a one-horse open sleigh,  
O'er the fields we go, laughing all the way,  
Bells on bobtails ring, making spirits bright,  
What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight, oh  
  
  
##### CHORUS:  
  
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way,  
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh, hey,  
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way,  
COh what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh.   
  
  
##### verse 2  
  
A day or two ago, I thought I'd take a ride  
And soon Miss Fanny Bright, was seated by my side  
The horse was lean and lank, misfortune seemed his lot  
He got into a drifted bank and we, we got up-sot, oh  
  
  
##### verse 3  
  
A day or two ago, the story I must tell  
I went out on the snow and on my back I fell  
A gent was riding by, In a one-horse open sleigh,  
He laughed as there I sprawling laid, but quickly drove away, oh  
  
  
##### verse 4:   
  
Now the ground is white, go it while you're young,  
Take the girls tonight and sing this sleighing song;  
Just get a bob-tailed bay two-forty as his speed  
Hitch him to an open sleigh and crack! you'll take the lead, Oh
