##### verse 1  
  
The first Noel, the angels did say   
was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay   
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep   
On a cold winter's night that was so  deep   
  
  
##### chorus  
  
  Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel  
  Born is the King of Israel   
    
    
##### verse 2  
  
They looked up and saw a star   
Shining in the east beyond them far   
And to the earth it gave great light   
And so it continued both day and night   
  
  
##### verse 3  
  
And by the light of that same star   
Three wise men came from coun try far  
To seek for-a king was their intent   
and to follow the star whereever it went  
  
  
##### verse 4  
  
That star drew nigh to the northwest  
O'er Beth lehe -m it took its rest  
and there it did both stop and stay  
right over the place where Jesus lay

Then entered in those wise men three  
Full rev 'rently upon their knee  
And offered there in his presence  
Their gold and mhyrr and frankinsence

So let us all with one accord  
Give prais es to our ri sen Lord  
Who hast made Heav'n and Earth of nought  
And with his blood mankind hath bought
