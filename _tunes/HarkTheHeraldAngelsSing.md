##### Verse 1  
  
Hark The Herald Angels Sing  
Glory To The Newborn King  
Peace On Earth And Mercy Mild  
God And Sinners Reconciled  
Joyful All Ye Nations Rise  
Join The Triumph Of The Skies  
With Th' Angelic Host Proclaim  
Christ Is Born In Beth-le-hem  
  
##### chorus  
  
Hark The Herald Angels Sing  
Glory To The New Born King  
  
##### verse 2  
  
Christ, by highest heaven adored;  
Christ, the everlasting Lord;  
Late in time behold him come,  
Offspring of the Virgin's womb.  
Veiled in flesh the Godhead, see;  
Hail the incarnate Deity,  
Pleased as man with men to dwell;  
Jesus, our Emmanuel!  
  
  
##### verse 3  
  
Hail, the heaven-born Prince of Peace!  
Hail, the Sun of Righteousness!  
Light and life to all He brings,  
Risen with healing in His wings,  
Mild he lays his glory by,  
Born that man no more may die,  
Born to raise the sons of earth,  
Born to give them second birth.  
  
  
##### verse 4  
  
Come, Desire of nations come,  
Fix in us Thy humble home;  
Rise, the Woman's conquering Seed,  
Bruise in us the Serpent's head.  
Adam's likeness now efface:  
Stamp Thine image in its place;  
Second Adam, from above,  
Reinstate us in thy love.
