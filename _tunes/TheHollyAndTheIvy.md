##### Verse 1  
  
The holly and the ivy  
When they are both full grown   
Of all the trees that are in the wood  
The holly bears the crown.  
  
  
##### Chorus  
  
   The rising of the sun    
   And the running of the deer  
   The playing of the merry organ  
    Sweet singing in the choir.   
  
  
##### Verse 2  
  
The holly bears the blossom  
white as the lily flower  
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ   
To be our sweet Sav-iour  
  
  
##### Verse 3  
  
The holly bears a berry  
red as a drop of blood  
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ  
To do poor sinners good  
  
  
##### Verse 4  
  
The holly bears a prickle  
as sharp as any thorn  
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ  
on Christmas Day in the morn
