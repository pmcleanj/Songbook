We Three Kings<br>
<br>
<br>
Verse 1<br>
<br>
We three kings of orient are<br>
Bearing gifts, we traverse afar<br>
Field and fountain, moor and mountain<br>
following yonder star<br>
<br>
<br>
chorus<br>
<br>
O â€“ o, <br>
Star of wonder, star of night<br>
Star with royal beauty bright<br>
Westward leading, still proceeding<br>
guide us to thy perfect light<br>
<br>
<br>
Verse 2<br>
<br>
Born a king on Bethlehem's plain<br>
Gold I bring to crown hHim again<br>
King forever, ceasing never<br>
over us all to reign<br>
<br>
<br>
Verse 3<br>
<br>
Frankinsence to offer have I.<br>
Incense owns a deity nigh.<br>
Prayer and praising all men raising<br>
Worship him: God most high.<br>
<br>
<br>
Verse 4<br>
<br>
Mhyrr is mine, its bitter perfume<br>
Breathes a life of gathering gloom<br>
Sorrowing, sighing, bleeding, dying<br>
sealed in a stone-cold tomb<br>
<br>
<br>
Verse 5<br>
<br>
Glorious now behold him arise<br>
King and God and Sacrifice<br>
Alleluia, alleluia<br>
earth to the heavens replies.
