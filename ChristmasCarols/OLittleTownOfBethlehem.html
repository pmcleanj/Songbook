O Little Town Of Bethlehem<br>
<br>
<br>
verse 1<br>
<br>
O little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie!<br>
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by.<br>
Yet in thy dark streets shineth the everlasting Light;<br>
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.<br>
<br>
verse 2<br>
<br>
For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above,<br>
While mortals sleep, the angels keep their watch of wondering love.<br>
O morning stars together, proclaim the holy birth,<br>
And praises sing to God the King, and peace to men on earth!<br>
<br>
verse 3<br>
<br>
How silently, how silently, the wondrous Gift is giv’n;<br>
So God imparts to human hearts the blessings of His Heav’n.<br>
No ear may hear His coming, but in this world of sin,<br>
Where meek souls will receive Him still, the dear Christ enters in.<br>
<br>
verse 4<br>
<br>
For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above,<br>
While mortals sleep, the angels keep their watch of wondering love.<br>
O morning stars together, proclaim the holy birth,<br>
And praises sing to God the King, and peace to men on earth!<br>
<br>
verse 5<br>
<br>
How silently, how silently, the wondrous Gift is giv’n;<br>
So God imparts to human hearts the blessings of His Heav’n.<br>
No ear may hear His coming, but in this world of sin,<br>
Where meek souls will receive Him still, the dear Christ enters in.<br>
<br>
verse 6<br>
<br>
O holy Child of Bethlehem, descend to us, we pray;<br>
ast out our sin, and enter in, be born in us today.<br>
We hear the Christmas angels the great glad tidings tell;<br>
O come to us, abide with us, our Lord Emmanuel!<br>
