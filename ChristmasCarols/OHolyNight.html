O Holy Night<br>
<br>
<br>
Verse 1<br>
<br>
O Holy night! The stars are brightly shining,<br>
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth!<br>
Long lay the world, in sin and error pining,<br>
'Till He appeared, and the soul felt its worth.<br>
A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices,<br>
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn!<br>
Fall on your knees! O hear the angel voices!<br>
O night divine, O night When Christ was born,<br>
O night, divine, O night, O night divine!<br>
<br>
Verse 2<br>
<br>
Led by the light of faith serenely beaming<br>
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand<br>
So led by light of a star sweetly gleaming<br>
Here came the wise men from Orient land<br>
The King of Kings lay in a lowly manger<br>
In all our trials born to be our friend<br>
He knows our need, to our weakness no stranger<br>
Behold your King, before him lowly bend<br>
Behold your King, your King! Before Him lowly bend<br>
<br>
Verse 3<br>
<br>
Truly He taught us to love one another.<br>
His law is Love, and His gospel is Peace.<br>
Chains shall He break, For the slave is our brother<br>
And in His Name all oppression shall cease.<br>
Sweet hymns of joy, In grateful chorus raise we,<br>
Let all within us praise His Holy Name!<br>
Christ is the Lord, O praise His Name forever;<br>
His pow'r and glory ever more proclaim,<br>
His pow'r and glory ever more proclaim.<br>
